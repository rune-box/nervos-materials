CKB defines some basic error codes:

* 1: CKB_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUND, means you have finished fetching all indices in a kind
* 2: CKB_ITEM_MISSING, means an entity is not present, such as fetching a type script from a cell that doesnâ€™t have one.
* 3: CKB_LENGTH_NOT_ENOUGH, means some data length is wrong such as invalid script args or signature length.
* 4: CKB_INVALID_DATA, means there is something wrong with the molecule serialization.
